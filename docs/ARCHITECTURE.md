# Button Heist Architecture

This document describes the internal architecture of ButtonHeist and how its components interact.

## System Overview

Button Heist is a distributed system that lets AI agents (and humans) inspect and control iOS apps. Its main components are:

1. **TheScore** - Cross-platform shared types (messages, models)
2. **TheInsideJob** - iOS framework embedded in the app being inspected
3. **ButtonHeist** - macOS client framework containing `TheFence` (command dispatch + request correlation) and `TheHandoff` (connection stack)
4. **buttonheist CLI** - Command-line tool for driving iOS apps
5. **ButtonHeistMCP** - MCP server for AI agent tool use

## Component Details

### TheScore

**Purpose**: Shared types and protocol definitions for cross-platform communication.

**Key Types**:
- `RequestEnvelope` - Wraps `ClientMessage` with an optional `requestId` for response correlation
- `ResponseEnvelope` - Wraps `ServerMessage` echoing the `requestId` back; push broadcasts use `requestId: nil`
- `ClientMessage` - Messages from client to server (37 cases including 9 touch gestures, 4 scroll/search commands, text input, edit actions, idle waiting, recording control, status, and watch)
- `ServerMessage` - Messages from server to client (18 cases including auth challenge/failure/approval, recording events, and interaction broadcasts)
- `HeistElement` - Flat UI element representation (heistId, label, value, traits, frame, custom content)
- `InterfaceNode` - Recursive tree node; leaves carry full `HeistElement` payloads, containers carry `ContainerInfo` + children
- `ContainerInfo` - Container metadata (type discriminator + type-specific payload + frame)
- `Interface` - Canonical UI interface data (single tree of `InterfaceNode` + computed `elements` flatten + deterministic screenDescription)
- `ServerInfo` - Device and app metadata (incl. instanceId, listeningPort, simulatorUDID, vendorIdentifier)
- `ActionResult` - Action outcome with method, optional message, interface delta, animation state, and optional `ScrollSearchResult`
- `ActionTarget` - Two-strategy element resolution: `heistId` (stable token) or `match: ElementMatcher` (accessibility predicate)
- `ElementMatcher` - Composable predicate for matching elements by label, identifier, value, traits, and excludeTraits
- `UnitPoint` - Unit coordinates (0–1) relative to element frame for device-independent swiping
- `ScrollToVisibleTarget` - Known-position scroll target wrapping an optional `ElementTarget`
- `WaitForTarget` - Wait for element to appear/disappear with predicate matching and timeout (max 30s)
- `ScrollSearchResult` - Scroll search diagnostics (scroll count, unique elements seen, total items, exhaustive flag, matched element)
- `ScreenPayload` - Base64-encoded PNG with dimensions
- `RecordingConfig` - Recording configuration (fps, scale, inactivity timeout, max duration)
- `RecordingPayload` - Completed recording with base64 H.264/MP4 video, metadata, and optional interaction log
- `InteractionEvent` - Single recorded interaction with command, result, and optional interface delta (also broadcast live to observers)
- `WatchPayload` - Payload for watch (observer) connections with optional token

**Design Decisions**:
- All types are `Codable` and `Sendable` for JSON serialization and concurrency safety
- No platform-specific imports (UIKit/AppKit)
- Wire protocol carries TLS transport metadata, envelope correlation, watch mode, session locking, action outcome signals, and composable element matching. Versioned via `buttonHeistVersion` (CalVer in `Messages.swift`); no separate wire-protocol version — handshake requires exact equality.

### TheInsideJob

**Purpose**: iOS server that captures and broadcasts UI element interface and handles remote interaction.

**Architecture**:
```

├── Settle-driven Polling (interface change detection via hash comparison, wakes on tripwire settle events)
└── Hierarchy Invalidation Flag (pulse-driven broadcast on settle transitions)
```

**Auto-Start Mechanism**:

TheInsideJob uses ObjC `+load` for automatic initialization:

```
ThePlant/
├── ThePlantAutoStart.h  (public header)
└── ThePlantAutoStart.m  (+load implementation → TheInsideJob_autoStartFromLoad)
```

When the framework loads:
1. `+load` is called automatically by the runtime
2. Reads configuration from environment variables or Info.plist:
   - `INSIDEJOB_DISABLE` / `InsideJobDisableAutoStart` - skip startup
   - `INSIDEJOB_POLLING_INTERVAL` / `InsideJobPollingInterval` - settle timeout for polling (default: 2.0s, min: 0.5s)
3. Creates a Task on MainActor to configure and start TheInsideJob singleton
4. Begins settle-driven polling for interface changes (wakes on TheTripwire settle events, not fixed timer)

**Threading Model**:
- Entire class marked `@MainActor`
- All UIKit operations on main thread
- Network callbacks dispatch to main actor
- Socket accept/read on dedicated GCD queues

**TLS Server (ServerTransport)**:
- Network framework implementation using `NWListener` and `NWConnection` with `NWProtocolTLS`
- IPv6 dual-stack (accepts both IPv4 and IPv6)
- Binds to all interfaces (`::`) for Bonjour compatibility
- OS-assigned port (advertised via Bonjour)
- Connection scope filtering: rejects connections at `.ready` using typed host classification and interface detection (loopback = simulator, `anpi` interface = USB, other = network). Controlled by `INSIDEJOB_SCOPE` env var; defaults to simulator + USB only.
- Newline-delimited JSON protocol (0x0A separator)
- Max 5 concurrent connections, 30 messages/second rate limit, 10 MB buffer limit
- Token-based authentication with session locking, envelope correlation, watch mode, and TLS transport metadata (v9.0)

    D -->|No| F["Reject — removeClient()<br>before authentication"]
```

### TheSafecracker (Touch Gesture & Text Input System)

**Purpose**: Synthesize touch gestures and inject text on the iOS device to allow remote interaction. Supports single-finger gestures (tap, long press, swipe, drag), multi-touch gestures (pinch, rotate, two-finger tap), and text input via UIKeyboardImpl.

**Architecture**:
```
TheSafecracker (stateful, @MainActor)
│
├── Single-Finger Gestures
│   ├── tap(at:)           → touchDown + touchUp
│   ├── longPress(at:)     → touchDown + delay + touchUp
│   ├── swipe(from:to:)    → touchDown + interpolated moves + touchUp
│   └── drag(from:to:)     → touchDown + interpolated moves + touchUp (slower)
│
├── Multi-Touch Gestures
│   ├── pinch(center:scale:)    → 2-finger spread/squeeze
│   ├── rotate(center:angle:)   → 2-finger rotation
│   └── twoFingerTap(at:)       → 2-finger simultaneous tap
│
├── Text Input (via UIKeyboardImpl)
│   ├── typeText(_:)             → addInputString: per character
│   ├── deleteText(count:)       → deleteFromInput per character
│   └── isKeyboardVisible()      → TheTripwire keyboard flag + UIKeyboardImpl fallback
│
├── N-Finger Primitives
│   ├── touchesDown(at: [CGPoint])  → Create N touches + HID event + sendEvent
│   ├── moveTouches(to: [CGPoint])  → Update all active touches
│   └── touchesUp()                 → End all active touches
│
└── Touch Stack
    ├── SyntheticTouchFactory     → UITouch creation via direct IMP invocation
    │   ├── performIntSelector    → setPhase:, setTapCount: (raw Int)
    │   ├── performBoolSelector   → _setIsFirstTouchForView:, setIsTap: (raw Bool)
    │   ├── performDoubleSelector → setTimestamp: (raw Double)
    │   └── setHIDEvent           → _setHidEvent: (raw pointer)
    ├── IOHIDEventBuilder         → Hand event with per-finger child events
    │   ├── @convention(c) typed function pointers via dlsym
    │   └── Finger identity/index for multi-touch tracking
    └── SyntheticEventFactory     → Fresh UIEvent per touch phase
```

**Text Input Design**:
- The iOS software keyboard is rendered by a separate remote process. Individual key views are not in the app's view hierarchy — only a `_UIRemoteKeyboardPlaceholderView` placeholder exists.
- TheSafecracker uses `UIKeyboardImpl.activeInstance` (via ObjC runtime) to get the keyboard controller, then calls `addInputString:` to inject text and `deleteFromInput` to delete — the same approach used by KIF (Keep It Functional).
- Keyboard visibility lives in TheTripwire now, using keyboard frame notifications plus a screen-bounds intersection check. `TheSafecracker.isKeyboardVisible()` reads that flag first, then falls back to `UIKeyboardImpl` active-input detection for hardware-keyboard scenarios.

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Direct IMP invocation**: `perform(_:with:)` boxes non-object types (Int, Bool, Double, UnsafeMutableRawPointer) as NSNumber objects, corrupting values passed to private ObjC methods. All private API calls use `method(for:)` + `unsafeBitCast` to `@convention(c)` typed function pointers.
- **`@convention(c)` for dlsym**: C function pointers from `dlsym` are 8 bytes; Swift closures are 16 bytes. All IOKit function pointer variables use `@convention(c)` for `unsafeBitCast` compatibility.
- **Fresh UIEvent per phase**: iOS 26's stricter validation rejects reused event objects. Each touch phase (began, moved, ended) creates a new UIEvent.
- **Overlay window filtering**: `windowForPoint()` filters out `FingerprintWindow` instances by type to prevent touch injection into the overlay window.

### TheMuscle (Authentication & Connection Approval)

**Purpose**: Manages client authentication, token persistence, and UI-based connection approval. Extracted from TheInsideJob to isolate auth concerns.

**Token Resolution**: When an explicit token is provided via `INSIDEJOB_TOKEN` or `InsideJobToken` plist key, it is used directly. Otherwise a fresh UUID is generated each launch (ephemeral — not persisted).

**Responsibilities**:
- Token resolution: explicit (env var / plist) → generate UUID
- Token-based authentication (validate incoming tokens)
- UI approval flow (present UIAlertController, handle allow/deny)
- Track authenticated client count and IDs
- Manage pending approval state
- Session locking: single-driver exclusivity with release timer
  - **Release timer** (`INSIDEJOB_SESSION_TIMEOUT`, default 30s): starts when all TCP connections drop
- Track active session driver identity and connections
- **Observer support**: Track read-only observer connections (`observerClients`). Observers require a valid token by default (`restrictWatchers` defaults to `true`). Set `INSIDEJOB_RESTRICT_WATCHERS=0` (env) or `InsideJobRestrictWatchers=false` (Info.plist) to allow unauthenticated watch connections.

**Integration**: TheMuscle communicates back to TheInsideJob via closures for socket operations (send, disconnect, markAuthenticated) and post-auth handling (onClientAuthenticated).

### Screen Capture

TheInsideJob captures the screen using `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`:
1. Finds the foreground window scene
2. Uses `drawHierarchy(in:afterScreenUpdates:)` to capture the full visual hierarchy (including SwiftUI)
3. Encodes as PNG, then base64
4. Returns `ScreenPayload` with dimensions and timestamp
5. Screen captures are automatically broadcast alongside interface changes during polling

### Screen Recording (Stakeout)

The `Stakeout` class provides on-device screen recording as H.264/MP4:

1. Client sends `startRecording` with optional configuration (fps, scale, timeouts)
2. InsideJob creates a `Stakeout` instance with a frame capture closure
3. Stakeout uses `AVAssetWriter` with H.264 codec, encoding frames from `drawHierarchy` compositing
4. Unlike screenshots, recording captures **include** the `FingerprintWindow` so interaction indicators are visible in the video.
5. Frames are captured at the configured FPS (default 8, range 1-15) using `afterScreenUpdates: false` to reduce main thread impact
6. Action-triggered bonus frames are captured after each successful action completes
7. During recording, each interaction through `performInteraction` captures the `ClientMessage`, `ActionResult`, and optional `InterfaceDelta` as an `InteractionEvent`, appended to Stakeout's in-memory interaction log
8. An inactivity monitor checks every second — recording auto-stops when no screen changes and no real interactions (actions, touches, typing) are received for the configured timeout. Pings and keepalive messages do not reset the inactivity timer.
9. File size is capped at 7MB to stay within the wire protocol's 10MB buffer limit after base64 encoding
10. Default resolution is 1x point size (native pixels / screen scale), configurable from 0.25x to 1.0x native
11. On completion, the video is base64-encoded and the interaction log (if non-empty) is included in the `recording(RecordingPayload)` message

### TheHandoff + Transport

**Purpose**: Discovery and connection logic split between the macOS client stack and the iOS server transport.

**Key Types**:
- `ServerTransport` - iOS-side TLS listener and Bonjour advertiser used by `TheInsideJob`
- `TLSIdentity` - Runtime-generated self-signed ECDSA (P-256) certificate management and fingerprinting
- `TheHandoff` - macOS-side coordinator for discovery, connection lifecycle, reconnection, and message routing
- `DeviceDiscovery` - Bonjour browser for simulator/network discovery
- `USBDeviceDiscovery` - USB tunnel discovery for physical devices
- `DeviceConnection` - TLS/TCP client with fingerprint verification
- `DiscoveredDevice` - Discovered device metadata (id, name, endpoint, simulatorUDID, installationId, displayDeviceName, instanceId, sessionActive, certFingerprint)

### TheFence (Command Dispatch Layer)

**Purpose**: Centralized command dispatch and session management. Both the CLI (`buttonheist session`) and the MCP server (`buttonheist-mcp`) are thin wrappers over TheFence.

**Location**: `ButtonHeist/Sources/TheButtonHeist/TheFence.swift`

**Architecture**:
```
TheFence (@ButtonHeistActor)
├── Configuration (deviceFilter, connectionTimeout, token, autoReconnect)
├── TheHandoff (device lifecycle, connection state)
├── Pending request correlation (requestId → continuation dictionaries)
├── Async wait methods (waitForActionResult, waitForInterface, waitForScreen, waitForRecording)
├── Device discovery + connection with configurable timeouts
├── Auto-reconnect (up to 60 attempts, 1s interval)
├── Command dispatch via execute(request:) → FenceResponse
└── Command.allCases (42 supported commands)
```

**Key Types**:
- `TheFence` - Main command dispatch class, `@ButtonHeistActor`-isolated
- `TheFence.Configuration` - Connection settings (device filter, timeout, token, auto-reconnect)
- `FenceResponse` - Typed enum for all response kinds (ok, error, help, status, devices, interface, action, screenshot, screenshotData, recording, recordingData) with `humanFormatted()` and `jsonDict()` serialization
- `FenceError` - Error enum with human-readable `LocalizedError` descriptions
- `TheFence.Command` - `String`-backed `CaseIterable` enum, single source of truth for the 42 supported commands

**Command Flow**:
1. Consumer calls `execute(request:)` with a `[String: Any]` dictionary containing a `command` field
2. TheFence auto-connects if not already connected (via its TheHandoff instance)
3. Dispatches to the appropriate command handler
4. Returns a typed `FenceResponse`

**Expectations and Batches**: Action commands accept an `expect` field to declare the expected outcome. In `run_batch`, the default `stop_on_error` policy halts at the first mismet expectation so `failedIndex` points at the action that broke, not a downstream step that failed in a stale state.

### Batch Execution

```mermaid

    D --> E{"Result type?"}

    E -->|".action with expect"| F{"expectation.met?"}
    E -->|".error or throw"| G[failure]
    E -->|"other"| H[success — append result]

    G --> I{"policy?"}
    I -->|stop_on_error| J["Set failedIndex = index<br>Break loop"]

    K --> C

    J --> L["Return .batch(<br>results, completedSteps,<br>failedIndex, totalTimingMs,<br>expectationsChecked, expectationsMet)"]
    C -->|"All steps done"| L
```

### ButtonHeistMCP (MCP Server)

**Purpose**: Standalone MCP server that exposes 23 purpose-built tools backed by TheFence. Allows AI agents to drive iOS apps via MCP tool calls.

**Location**: `ButtonHeistMCP/`

**Architecture**:
```
ButtonHeistMCP (Swift executable, macOS 14+)
├── main.swift — Server setup, tool handler, response rendering
├── ToolDefinitions.swift — 23 tool schemas
└── Package.swift — Dependencies: ButtonHeist + swift-sdk (MCP)
```

**Key Behaviors**:
- 23 tools dispatch through `fence.execute(request:)`
- Screenshots are returned as inline MCP image content items
- Recording video data is replaced with a size summary to keep responses readable
- Environment variables: `BUTTONHEIST_DEVICE`, `BUTTONHEIST_TOKEN`, `BUTTONHEIST_SESSION_TIMEOUT`

### ButtonHeist (macOS Client Framework)

**Purpose**: Single-import macOS framework. Re-exports `TheScore` and provides `TheFence` (command dispatch + request correlation) and `TheHandoff` (transport stack).

**Usage**: `import ButtonHeist` gives access to all types (TheFence, TheHandoff, HeistElement, Interface, DiscoveredDevice, etc.)

**Architecture**:
```
TheFence (@ButtonHeistActor) — command dispatch + request-response correlation
├── TheHandoff — device lifecycle + session state
│   ├── DeviceDiscovery (Bonjour)
│   ├── USBDeviceDiscovery (CoreDevice tunnels)
│   └── DeviceConnection (TLS transport + fingerprint verification)
├── TheBookKeeper — session logs, artifact storage, compression
│   ├── SessionPhase state machine (idle → active → closed → archived)
│   ├── Append-only JSONL session logs with binary data exclusion
│   ├── Artifact storage (screenshots, recordings) with sequence-numbered filenames
│   └── Session archival (gzip log compression + tar.gz archive)
├── Pending request correlation (requestId → continuation dictionaries)
└── Async wait methods (waitForActionResult, waitForInterface, waitForScreen, waitForRecording)
```

**API Design**:

1. **Callbacks (Imperative)**: TheHandoff exposes typed closures for connection lifecycle events
2. **Async/Await**: TheFence provides `waitForActionResult(timeout:)`, `waitForScreen(timeout:)`, etc. for command scripting
3. **Command dispatch**: `TheFence.execute(request:)` is the single entry point for CLI and MCP

**Auto-Subscribe on Connect**: When `autoSubscribe` is enabled, `TheHandoff` sends `subscribe` and `requestInterface` after connecting. Screen snapshots are requested explicitly.

**Observe Mode**: When `observeMode` is enabled on `TheHandoff`, the underlying `DeviceConnection` completes the `serverHello` / `clientHello` handshake, waits for `authRequired`, then sends `watch(WatchPayload)` instead of `authenticate`. This establishes a read-only observer connection that receives broadcasts without claiming a session lock.

**Connection State Machine**:
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> disconnected
    disconnected --> connecting: connect()
    connecting --> connected: success
    connecting --> disconnected: failure
    connected --> disconnected: disconnect() / failure
```

## Data Flow

### Agent Flow (CLI and MCP)

AI agents can drive iOS apps via either the CLI (`buttonheist session`) or the MCP server (`buttonheist-mcp`). Both are thin wrappers over `TheFence`, which handles device discovery, connection, and command dispatch.

**Via MCP (preferred for AI agents)**:
```
Agent → MCP tool call: get_interface {}
  └── ButtonHeistMCP → TheFence → TheHandoff → TheInsideJob
  └── Response: JSON interface with elements

Agent → MCP tool call: activate {identifier: "loginButton"}
  └── TheFence.execute() → activate → ActionResult with delta
  └── Response: JSON with delta (noChange, valuesChanged, elementsChanged, screenChanged)
```

**Via CLI (Bash tool calls)**:
```
1. Stateless commands (one-shot, reconnects each time)
   └── Bash: buttonheist get_interface --format json
   └── Bash: buttonheist get_screen --output /tmp/screen.png
   └── Bash: buttonheist one_finger_tap --identifier loginButton

2. Session mode (persistent connection, JSON lines on stdin/stdout)
   └── Bash: buttonheist session --format json
   └── stdin: {"command":"get_interface"}  → stdout: JSON response
   └── stdin: {"command":"one_finger_tap","identifier":"loginButton"}  → stdout: JSON response
   └── TheFence maintains connection across commands
```

**Best practice for rapid interaction**: Use action `delta` responses and only call `get_interface` when context is stale.

### Discovery Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant IJ as TheInsideJob
    participant SS as ServerTransport
    participant NS as NetService (Bonjour)
    participant HC as TheHandoff
    participant NB as NWBrowser

    IJ->>SS: start(port: 0)
    Note over SS: OS-assigned port
    IJ->>NS: publish("_buttonheist._tcp")
    Note over NS: Service name: "{AppName}#{instanceId}"<br>instanceId = INSIDEJOB_ID or UUID prefix
    IJ->>NS: setTXTRecord()
    Note over NS: simudid, installationid,<br>instanceid, devicename,<br>sessionactive, certfp, transport

    HC->>NB: start(for: "_buttonheist._tcp")
    NB-->>HC: service found
    Note over HC: Extract TXT record →<br>simulatorUDID, installationId,<br>instanceId, sessionActive, certFingerprint
    HC->>HC: discoveredDevices.append(device)
```

### Multi-Instance Discovery

When running multiple instances (e.g., multiple simulators), each instance has a unique identity:

- **Instance ID**: Configurable via `INSIDEJOB_ID` env var, or defaults to first 8 chars of a per-launch UUID. Appears in the Bonjour service name (e.g., `MyApp#a1b2c3d4`) and TXT record.
- **Simulator UDID**: The `SIMULATOR_UDID` environment variable, automatically set by the iOS Simulator. Published in the Bonjour TXT record under key `simudid`.
Clients (CLI, GUI, scripts) can filter devices by any of these identifiers. The matching logic is case-insensitive and supports prefix matching for IDs, allowing partial UDID matching (e.g., `--device DEADBEEF`).

### Connection Flow

```mermaid

    participant HC as TheHandoff

    HC->>IJ: connect(to: device)
    Note over HC,IJ: TCP connection established (NWConnection)
    IJ-->>HC: serverHello
    HC->>IJ: clientHello

        alt User taps Allow
            TM-->>IJ: approved
            IJ-->>HC: authApproved(token)
            IJ-->>HC: info(ServerInfo)
        else User taps Deny
            TM-->>IJ: denied
            IJ-->>HC: authFailed
            IJ-xHC: disconnect
        end
    end

    Note over HC: connectionPhase = .connected
    HC->>IJ: subscribe
    HC->>IJ: requestInterface
```

### Watch (Observer) Connection Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant WC as Watch Client
    participant IJ as TheInsideJob
    participant TM as TheMuscle

    WC->>IJ: connect(to: device)
    Note over WC,IJ: TCP connection established
    IJ-->>WC: serverHello
    WC->>IJ: clientHello
    IJ-->>WC: authRequired

    WC->>IJ: watch(token:"")
    Note over IJ: TheMuscle routes to handleWatchRequest

    alt Default (restrictWatchers=true)
        alt Valid token
            TM-->>IJ: approved
            IJ-->>WC: info(ServerInfo)
        else Invalid/empty token
            IJ-->>WC: authFailed
            IJ-xWC: disconnect
        end
    else INSIDEJOB_RESTRICT_WATCHERS=0
        TM-->>IJ: auto-approved
        IJ-->>WC: info(ServerInfo)
    end

    Note over WC: Auto-subscribed to broadcasts
    IJ-->>WC: interface (pushed on change)
    IJ-->>WC: interaction (when driver acts)
```

Observers never claim a session lock and cannot send commands. They receive the same `interface` and `interaction` broadcasts as subscribed drivers. Screenshots are never broadcast; they require an explicit `requestScreen`.

### Interface Update Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["tripwire.waitForAllClear()<br>(settle-driven, not timer-based)"] --> B["broadcastIfChanged()"]
    B --> B2["stash.refresh()<br/>(always runs — keeps state fresh)"]
    B2 --> B1{"hasSubscribers?"}
    B1 -->|No| A
    B1 -->|Yes| E["snapshot(.visible) → [ScreenElement]"]
    E --> F["toWire() → [HeistElement]"]
    F --> G["Compute hash of elements array"]
    G --> H{"Hash changed?"}
    H -->|No| A
    H -->|Yes| I["Create Interface(timestamp, elements, tree)"]
    I --> J["Broadcast interface to all clients"]
    J --> A
```

### Action Flow (accessibility actions)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant IJ as TheInsideJob
    participant TSC as TheSafecracker

    Client->>IJ: activate / increment / decrement / customAction
    IJ->>IJ: stash.refresh() (parse → apply)
    IJ->>IJ: stash.resolveTarget(elementTarget)
    IJ->>IJ: Resolve live NSObject from ScreenElement

    alt activate
        IJ->>IJ: object.accessibilityActivate()
        alt Returns false (fallback)
            IJ->>TSC: tap(at: activationPoint)
            Note over TSC: Synthetic touch injection
        end
    else increment
        IJ->>IJ: object.accessibilityIncrement()
    else decrement
        IJ->>IJ: object.accessibilityDecrement()
    else customAction
        IJ->>IJ: Find UIAccessibilityCustomAction by name
        IJ->>IJ: Call handler or target/selector
    end

    IJ-->>Client: actionResult(success, method)
    Note over IJ: Show fingerprint overlay on success
```

### Action Flow (touch gestures)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant IJ as TheInsideJob
    participant TSC as TheSafecracker
    participant App as UIApplication

    Client->>IJ: touchTap / touchDrag / touchPinch / etc.
    IJ->>IJ: Resolve target point
    Note over IJ: From element activation point<br>or explicit coordinates

    alt touchTap with element target
        IJ->>IJ: Try accessibilityActivate()
        alt Returns false
            IJ->>TSC: Synthetic touch fallback
        end
    else Coordinate target or other gesture
        IJ->>TSC: Perform gesture
    end

    Note over TSC: tap / longPress / swipe / drag<br>pinch / rotate / twoFingerTap
    TSC->>TSC: Create UITouch + IOHIDEvent
    TSC->>App: sendEvent()

    IJ-->>Client: actionResult(success, method, message)
    Note over IJ: Show fingerprint overlay<br>Continuous gestures show tracking
```

## Network Protocol

See [WIRE-PROTOCOL.md](WIRE-PROTOCOL.md) for complete protocol specification.

**Summary**:
- Protocol version: 9.0
- Transport: TLS over TCP (Network framework NWListener/NWConnection with NWProtocolTLS)
- Authentication: Token-based (required for driver connections), with optional on-device UI approval for auto-generated tokens. Watch (observer) connections require a token by default (`restrictWatchers` defaults to `true`).
- Session locking: Single-driver exclusivity with release timer on disconnect. Observers do not claim sessions.
- Discovery: Bonjour/mDNS (`_buttonheist._tcp`)
- Encoding: Newline-delimited JSON (UTF-8)
- Port: OS-assigned (advertised via Bonjour)

## Connection Methods

### WiFi (Bonjour)
- Service advertised via mDNS
- Client discovers via NWBrowser
- TLS connection to advertised endpoint

## Threading Considerations

### TheInsideJob (iOS)
- `@MainActor` for UIKit compatibility
- Parser must run on main thread
- Socket accept/read on GCD queues
- Message handling dispatched to main
- Interface updates debounced by 300ms

### TheHandoff / TheFence (macOS)
- `@ButtonHeistActor` for backend isolation (discovery, connection, command dispatch)
- NWBrowser for discovery on a dedicated queue
- NWConnection for data transport
- Message processing dispatched to `@ButtonHeistActor`

## Error Handling

### Connection Errors
- Network unavailable → `.failed("Network error")`
- Host unreachable → `.failed("Connection refused")`
- Unexpected disconnect → `onDisconnected?(error)`

### Protocol Errors
- Invalid JSON → Logged, message dropped
- Unknown message type → Logged, message dropped
- Missing required field → Error response sent

### Action Errors
- Element not found → `ActionResult(success: false, method: .elementNotFound)`
- Element not interactive → `ActionResult(success: false, message: "reason")`
- View not interactive → `TapResult.viewNotInteractive(reason:)`
- Injection failed → Falls back to high-level methods

## Configuration

See [API Reference](API.md#configuration) for the complete list of environment variables, Info.plist keys, and their defaults.
