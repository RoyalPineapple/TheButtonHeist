# Process Boundaries

Button Heist in-process versus the out-of-process drivers. Out-of-process automation must serialize a snapshot of the accessibility tree across an IPC boundary and synthesize input at computed coordinates; Button Heist holds the live element in the same process and asks it to activate the way assistive technology does. This diagram answers "why does running inside the app matter?"

Notes:

- The copy is made at the IPC boundary: out-of-process tools can only ever see a serialized snapshot, because iOS has no public cross-process live-tree API. Button Heist never crosses that boundary — the wire carries commands and receipts, not the tree walk.
- The live element is held in `LiveCapture.ElementRef` as a weak reference, captured per parse and invalidated on the next parse — live access without keeping UIKit objects alive past their lifetime.
- Activation goes through the element's own contract: `accessibilityActivate()` first (what VoiceOver invokes), and on decline a tap at the element's **declared** activation point — not a hittable point computed from the frame (see [activation-policy.md](activation-policy.md)).
- The parser is the AccessibilitySnapshot fork under `submodules/AccessibilitySnapshotBH` — the same tree walk assistive technology semantics are derived from, run in-process on demand.
