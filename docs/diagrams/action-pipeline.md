# Action Pipeline

One durable action is a leaf in the complete-heist reducer. The reducer opens
observation before dispatch, evaluates every admitted event in order, and
returns one typed result.

The action leaf owns predicate progress but performs no effects. The host owns
dispatch, viewport work, live resources, clock reads, and waits. The reducer
owns deadline and cancellation meaning. The
stream owns pulse-driven capture and notification admission. The Vault owns
current truth and history. Successful steps release history before the next
leaf; their immutable evidence stays in the result. `ActionResult` is projected
once from dispatch truth plus that evidence.
